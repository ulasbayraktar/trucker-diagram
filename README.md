## Trucker Diagram

This page is a diagram illustrating what types of goods each business or industry on the server can purchase, where they can purchase them from within the Trucker System, and where they can subsequently sell them. This diagram serves to understand the supply chain and trade relationships between businesses or industries and is an essential tool for managing logistics processes on Los Sants Roleplay.

This diagram was originally created by former Los Santos Roleplay developers, but the page had become non-functional. I made it operational again by coding it.
